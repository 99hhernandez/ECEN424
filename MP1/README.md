## INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this machine problem is to familiarize you with the basics of Java programming.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this assignment, implement a calculator that performs the operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication.


## OPERATION
Under the main method, a new Calculator object called mycalc must be created. In your code, call the setname method to set your group number (eg. Group 5) as the name of mycalc. The system must print out the following line (using the getname method):
Welcome to the Calculator designed by ”mycalc.name ”.
Enter A to Add, S to Subtract, M to Multiply ,and Q to quit.
Parse the input as a String and then output:
Enter argument 1
Enter argument 2
In each case above, wait for an input, parse each input as a String, and then convert to Float. Call the appropriate method on mycalc. Print out the answer using the format
The sum/difference/product of argument 1 and argument 2 is the answer
Put the whole code in a while loop, and terminate when Q is entered. Any other inputs should returnthe user to the Welcome message.
